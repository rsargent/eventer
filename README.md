Very simple HTML-based event capture and uploader for Fluxtream.  (Old;  originally uploaded to bodytrack and needs some update to authenticate to fluxtream)

pomotrack.html is the most up-to-date part;  allows starting and aborting pomodoros, adding and rearranging post-it-style todo items, and typing in free-form events in the bottom pane.
